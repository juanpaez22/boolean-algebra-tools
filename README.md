# Boolean Equation Tools

To make my life a little easier in my Digital Logic Design class, I am writing a program to evaluate boolean algebra expressions using a truth table for all possible input values, and then generating the boolean function in sum-of-minterms canonical form. I am creating a simple GUI to allow the easy insertion of logical operators and the display of the truth table / SOM equation.
